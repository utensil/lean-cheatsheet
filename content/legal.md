# Legal Information


### Operator

Utensil Song <sup><a href="mailto:TODO">ðŸ“§</a></sup>

### Hosting, GDPR, Privacy Information

- The content, supporting developer assets and metadata are usually **hosted on Github** so their privacy and tracking legalese applies.
- Unfortunately, at the time of writing, we use embedded fonts that are hosted on Google Fonts (**help with fixing that would be greatly appreciated!**). No cookies are retained to our knowledge. Google has an entry on this matter: [What does using the Google Fonts API mean for the privacy of my users?](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq).
- The **Edit & Run** feature of the TODO section embeds the TODO. All code entered there is sent to and processed on their servers.
- The user's **local storage** may be used for storing user settings between sessions (e.g. dark mode, ligatures). This information never leaves the user's machine.

### Copyright Information

We use the following model:

**tl;dr**, if you want to
- copy a Lean snippet or example: CC0, just do it
- copy or embed the entire site: CC-BY, please give credit (also to 3rd party assets, see below).

**In detail**, this cheat sheet ("work") consists of:

- text (tables, guides, Lean code) addressing language-related content ("content")

- metadata, such as the real names of contributors (e.g., on Github or the site), information from the Git repo, any other information not directly related to end-user content ... ("metadata")

The **content** of this work is licensed as CC0 from the European Union, with contributions from all over the world.
